## ⚙️ Methodology
The project follows five main steps:

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Reviewed dataset structure and quality  
   - Verified consistency of IDs, dates, and ranges  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Converted datatypes (IDs, dates, numerical fields)  
   - Treated missing values and errors  
   - Aggregated monthly activity per user (calls, SMS, data usage, revenue)  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Customer behavior across tariffs (minutes, SMS, data usage)  
   - Mean, variance, and standard deviation of usage metrics  
   - Histograms and distribution analysis  

4. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - **H₀ vs H₁**: Average revenue of Surf vs Ultimate customers is equal/different  
   - **H₀ vs H₁**: Average revenue of NY–NJ region vs other regions is equal/different  
   - Applied statistical tests with chosen significance level (α)  

5. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarized insights on which tariff is more profitable  
   - Business implications for marketing and budget allocation
